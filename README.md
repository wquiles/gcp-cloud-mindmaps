# gcp-cloud-mindmaps

### What
This repo contains mindmaps that several of us at Google have created about the GCP (Google Cloud Platform) based on public information. Since all of the information is already in the public domain, feel free to use and share these mindmaps as you see fit.

### Why
Creating the mindmaps helps us learn, and helps us explain a topic to others.  Since the mimdmaps have many direct links to public documentaiton, anyone can quickly learn more about any particular area they find intersting.  

### Software
We are using [Xmind software](https://www.xmind.app/) to create these mindmaps. These links below are read-only exports from the desktop Xmind software, however note that these will be open in any browser without having to install any software nor browser extensions.

### Contributions
Several of us at Google work together to create, peer review, and publish these mindmaps.  Thanks much to Keith M. and many others for your help.

### Known issues
So far the only issue I know about is with the export from Xmind in terms of capitalizing. For example, a mindmap with a tittle like "GCP Security Fundamentals" will export as "Gcp Security Fundamentals". We have contacted Xmind and they logged this bug, and hope that will be fixed in a future release.

### Contact information
If you have suggestions, fixes, improvements, or ideas to make these better or create new ones, please contact me at my work email: wquiles@google.com
